1. Install Python 3.11 or greater
   -  Download the installer for Windows from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/. In most cases "Windows installer (64bit)" will be the correct package.
   -  Run the installer. Depending on the configuration of the Windows computer you may need to enter your password or use a separate administrator
      account for the installation.
